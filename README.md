### Just some of the stuff I've done to further my knowledge of Python.

[UploadCheck.py](./UploadCheck.py) is a script to check the file type restrictions on the upload page of a HTB machine.

[39161.py](./39161.py) is the Exploit-DB Rejetto HTTP File Server (HFS) 2.3.x - Remote Command Execution Python2 script re-written and updated with a few more arguments in Python3.  Wanted to add the local host and local port used as arguments instead of leaving them hardcoded.  
 
[The Classic FizzBuzz example](./fizzbuzz.py) This stemmed from a conversation in InfoSec Prep Discord.  I've personally never heard of this and wanted to see if I could do it.


Just a couple of scripts from the Udemy class Python for Pentesters by Christi Zot

[InfoScanner](./Python_For_Pentesters/infoscanner.py)

[NMapScanner](./Python_For_Pentesters/nmapscanner.py)

[SubDomain Scanner](./Python_For_Pentesters/subdomain.py)
